\title{Li correction of p-values.}
\usage{
adjustLi(pvalues)
}
\arguments{
\item{pvalues}{Raw p-values in either a vector or a matrix. Note that in case the p-values are in a matrix, all the values are used for the correction. Therefore, if the matrix contains repeated values (as those output by some methods in this package), the repetitions have to be removed.}
}
\value{
A vector or matrix with the corrected p-values
}
\description{
This function takes the particular list of possible hypthesis to correct for multiple testing, as defined in Li (2008).
}
\details{
The test has been implemented according to the version in Garcia \emph{et al.} (2010), page 2680-2682. This is a simple procedure that provides good results when the highest p-value corrected is below 0.5. However, When the highest p-value is close to 1 the correction is extremely conservative. Actually, when the highest p-value is 1, all the corrected p-values are set at 1. Therefore, it is not advisable to be used under these circumstances.
